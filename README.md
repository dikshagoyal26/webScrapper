# Web Scrapper

Web scraping is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.

### Packages Used


Nodejs has a large library of packages that simplyfy different tasks. For Webscrapping, packages called Puppeteer, request-promise and cheerio are used.

request-promise package is the simplified HTTP request client 'request' with Promise support. request is a peer dependency of request-promise.The request package is used to download web pages.

Cheerio package generates a DOM tree and provides a subset of the jQuery function set to manipulate it, i.e. cheerio is used to parse html.

Puppeteer is a headless Chrome API for NodeJS developers who want very granular control over their scraping activity.
